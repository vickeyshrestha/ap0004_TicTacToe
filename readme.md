<h1> Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>
I used Jetbrain's IntelliJ to develop and test this application. 
I was encountering the issue where my IDE was failing to find any Class declarations. I am not sure if everyone will encounter the same issue, 
but if you do, this is how I solve the issue.

- Right-click src folder
- Mark Directory as > Sources Root
